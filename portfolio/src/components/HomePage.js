                This Weather App was created using HTML5 and CSS3 with React.
                Using a Weather API, I was able to integrate the weather data.
                Different components were used to display the various sections
                and features of the application. A node package was used to
                integrate the animated react weather icons. A unit conversion
                feature was also integrated in order to transition between
                imperial and metric units of measurement to cater to a variety
                of users and enhance user experience.
